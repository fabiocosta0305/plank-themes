# Changelog
  
## (2020-08-01)

initial commit.  
Added a shadow to anti-shade and changed color to match elementary os 5 a bit better (hopefully)  
Added install script I yoinked from another repository

## (2020-08-06)

Added Nordic and Nordic light. Nordic uses the Nordic color palette as it's base color while Nordic Light is a lighter color to contrast against the Nordic palette.  Both themes also have a more rounded border, highlights and icon shadows to (hopefully) help with readability.  I'm not a designer, i'm doing my best.  Create an issue with suggestions.  Also I am starting work on a graphical tool to modify plank themes, I am still a beginner so no ETA as of yet.

## (2020-11-20)

Added Y-ru theme (based on yaru)

## (2021-07-04)

Updated each theme so they are now consistant in shape between them.  
Added borders to each for better readibility on dark and light backgrounds.  
Renamed Nordic to Nordic-Night and Nordic-Light to Nordic-Snow.  

## (2021-10-19)  
  
Updated installer script to properly create folders if they don't exist.
Installer now uses zenity instead of being just cli based.
